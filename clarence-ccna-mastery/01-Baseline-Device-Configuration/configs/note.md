\### Day 2 — Switch Baseline Identity \& Management



A Layer 2 switch requires a logical Layer 3 management interface (SVI) to support remote management protocols such as SSH and ping.



The default gateway is used only by the switch itself when sending management traffic to devices outside the local subnet. It does not affect frame forwarding or enable routing.



Console access is the final recovery mechanism when network-based management fails. For this reason, the console must be secured using authentication and session timeouts, but never disabled.



Verification is performed before documentation to ensure configurations are correct, active, and persistent.
