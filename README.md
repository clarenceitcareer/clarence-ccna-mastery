# Clarence CCNA Mastery

This repository documents my end-to-end training to master the Cisco CCNA (200-301)
using first-principles learning, real-world network design, and disciplined Cisco IOS CLI execution.

This is not a collection of random labs.
It is a structured engineering system designed to build deep understanding,
exam readiness, and job-ready network skills.

## What This Repository Proves

- Ability to design, configure, and verify Cisco-based networks
- Mastery of Cisco IOS CLI in correct operational sequence
- Understanding of networking from fundamentals to security and automation
- Professional documentation, troubleshooting, and failure analysis
- Readiness for CCNA exam and entry-to-mid level network roles

---

## Learning Methodology

This system combines:
- Harvard / MIT / Caltech first-principles teaching style
- Project-based engineering execution
- Barbara Oakley’s *Learning How to Learn* principles
- Active recall and verification-driven learning
- Real-world configuration order used in enterprise environments

Every concept is:
1. Explained clearly (theory)
2. Implemented correctly (CLI)
3. Verified objectively (show/debug commands)
4. Broken and fixed (failure analysis)

No command is typed without understanding what it does and why it exists.

## Repository Structure

Each section aligns with the official CCNA exam domains and real-world practice.
